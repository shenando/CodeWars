# Code Wars
A colletion of code kata problems and my solutions. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

All problems are solved using Javascript

#### Optimizations

I would like to go back and improve the code by making it as short and clean as possible, the current focus at the time has been on solving problems and making sure they work.

## Lessons Learned:

As time passes, I really am benefiting from the spaced repattition as the practice has allowed me to be more comfortable with different methods and syntax. I'm improving daily and it's a great feeling!
